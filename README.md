ManualCamera is a small project from 2015, where I had a go at the then-new AVFoundation API for setting the ISO, shutter speed and focus position manually. My goal was to create a GUI that is reminiscent of classic system cameras with dial controls.

The original code was written almost completely in Swift. Only *MCCameraController* was written in Objective-C in order to handle the Objective-C exceptions thrown by the older versions of AVFoundation. The source code in this public repository is an updated version, completely in Swift.
